# Silverline Python Library

## ```sl.runtime```: Virtual Runtime

The ``virtual runtime'' is a python module which allows a python program to register with the SilverLine framework as a runtime with pre-specified APIs (being able to perform specific functions instead of execute arbitrary WebAssembly modules).

This module is not yet functional.

## ```sl.client```: SilverLine testing client

Simple client for launching modules, etc.
